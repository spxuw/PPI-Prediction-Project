# Overview

Comprehensive understanding of the human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network will offer global insights into cellular organization, genome function, and genotypeâ€“phenotype relationships. Discovery of new PPIs could facilitate very important tasks, such as drug target identification and therapeutic design [1-4]. Yet, the human PPI network is highly incomplete, containing only 20% of all estimated interactions [5], noisy and prone to investigative biases [14]. Network and machine learning methods can accelerate knowledge acquisition in biomedical networks by significantly reducing the number of alternatives to be confirmed in clinical assessments. Yet, high incompleteness of the human PPI network represents a severe limitation that may reduce the effectiveness of state-of-the-art computational methodologies. In this context, the prediction of new PPIs based on experimentally observed PPIs, becomes a particularly challenging task. The objective of this challenge is to compare different link prediction methods (using various performance metrics), on both synthetic and real networks, to select the best link prediction methods for the human PPI network. 

# Repo Contents of each team
* code: source code of link prediction method of team.
* data: one synthetic network generated by DMC model and one real network: HuRI.
* results: (i). Output file contains 5 columns (each column corresponding to a performance metric) and 11 rows (the first row is: AUC, AUPRC, P(5000), NDCG, time(s); and the other 10 rows correspond to the results from the 10-fold cross validation). (ii). Output file includes 3 columns (the first two columns corresponding to the Ensembl_gene_ids of the two proteins, the third column corresponds to the score of this predicted PPI), and 500 rows (each row representing a new PPI).
