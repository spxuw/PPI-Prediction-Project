# Description
Our protein-protein interaction prediction approach is based on the training of a generative adversarial network using Wasserstein distance-based loss improved with gradient penalty performing image-to-image translation conditioned on embedding information of the network topology [1–3]. This model consists of a generator and a discriminator trained by an adversarial learning process [4].  
The input for the generator is the embedding of the 90% splitted versions of the original network generated by the node2vec algorithm [5] along with a set of adjacency matrices of induced subgraphs together covering most of the nodes and edges of the original network.
