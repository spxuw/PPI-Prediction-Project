## List of releases

### v1.0
Initial version developed and submitted for the Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction Challenge organized by the International Network Medicine Consortium in 2020-2021 (https://www.network-medicine.org/).

### v1.1
Improved version with bug fixes.

### v1.2
Version to compare the usage of raw topological, embedding and combined input data for cGAN training. Our methodological manuscript describing these comparisons has been published in [BMC Bioinformatics](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-022-04598-x).

### v1.3
This version combines two previous versions (v1.0 and v1.2) under one common launcher, which enables better parametrization and easier runs on arbitrary networks.
