# Code description
Internal_validation.py is an example code to calculate the AUROC, AUPRC, P(5000) and NDCG.
External_validation.py is an example code to output the scores of top-500 links.
Note that in internal validation, we used 10 different randomly splitings. However, the participants should report the metrics with 10-fold cross validation.

# Computing environment
All the source codes are tested with python 3.8.3 on macOS 11.01.

# External packages/libraries 
The following python dependencies are required:
  - python==3.8.3
  - networkx==2.5
  - pandas==1.1.4
  - numpy==1.19.2 
  - sklearn==0.23.2
  
# Additional dataset used in the method
N/A

# Method description
The method used in this example code is the heuristic score: Common Neighbors for node pair. The common neighbors algorithm quantifies the overlap or similarity of two nodes as follows[1]:
