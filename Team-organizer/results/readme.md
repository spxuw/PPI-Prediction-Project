Each team is asked to submit two output files: (i): 5 columns (each column corresponding to a performance metric) and 11 rows (the first row is: AUC, AUPRC, P(5000), NDCG, time(s); and the other 10 rows correspond to the results from the 10-fold cross validation). See example HuRI_Metrics.csv. (ii): 3 columns (the first two columns corresponding to the Ensembl_gene_ids of the two proteins, the third column corresponds to the score of this predicted PPI), and 500 rows (each row representing a new PPI). See example HuRI_top_500_scores.csv.
